Allows you to use your own image for the world map in Derail Valley.

Based on [template-umm](https://github.com/derail-valley-modding/template-umm)

Features
--------

- Change the map image
- Enable/disable:
  - Station names

Installing
----------

Go to the releases tab on the right, download the latest release, and install it with [UMM](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21).

Usage
-----

In the UMM UI, click on the settings icon for the mod, and enter the path to the image you want to use.
It should be a PNG (.png) or JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg) file.
Either restart the game or click the reload button when changing the image. If no image is given it will use the default texture.

**Options will not take effect until reloading from the main menu.**

Issues
------

Don't create issues here, I won't read them.
Instead, ping `@adaad` in the [Altfuture Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/altfuture).
